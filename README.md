This project focuses on predicting product prices in the Backpack Price Prediction Kaggle competition. Rather than applying a basic regression model, the pipeline leverages feature engineering, real-world intuition, and model optimization to improve predictive accuracy in a noisy commercial dataset.

---

🔹 **Key Highlights:**

📌 **Feature Engineering**: Constructed product-specific features such as weight-to-compartment interactions, log transformations for skewed fields, and multi-way categorical combinations (e.g., brand + material + size).  
📌 **Modeling**: Benchmarked XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, incorporating Optuna for tuning and using a stacked ensemble with Ridge regression for final predictions.  
📌 **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated using RMSE on both notebook and Kaggle leaderboard submissions to track generalization.

---

📊 **Technologies Used:**

- Python 🐍 Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Winning Model**: Stacked Ensemble (XGBoost + LightGBM + CatBoost)  
- Feature Engineering & Preprocessing (One-hot encoding, interaction terms, outlier removal)  
- Hyperparameter Tuning (Optuna, Cross-Validation)  
- GitHub for Version Control 🛠  

---

🔬 **Innovative Methods Used:**  
While many tabular models focus solely on boosting performance, this project highlights the value of domain-aware feature construction and rigorous evaluation across multiple modeling pipelines. A shared preprocessing module ensured fairness across models and streamlined experimentation.

This project focuses on predicting patient outcomes in the **Cirrhosis Outcome Prediction** Kaggle competition. Instead of applying a basic classification model, I utilized **feature engineering**, **domain knowledge**, and **model optimization techniques** to improve multi-class prediction accuracy.  

🔹 **Key Highlights:**  

📌 **Feature Engineering:** Created domain-specific features like bilirubin-to-albumin ratio, log transformations for skeId features, and binary indicators for critical thresholds.  
📌 **Modeling:** Compared **XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost**, fine-tuning hyperparameters and using **stacking ensembles** for performance gains.  
📌 **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated using **multi-class log loss** and **cross-validation** to ensure model generalization. 

📊 **Technologies Used:**  

- **Python** 🐍 Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Winning Model** XGBoost
- **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing** (One-hot encoding, ratio calculations, outlier removal)  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** (Randomized Search, Stratified K-Fold Validation)  
- **GitHub for Version Control** 🛠  

**🔬 Innovative Methods Used:**  
Many classification models for medical datasets rely on direct correlations or minimal preprocessing. This project takes a more **data-driven and clinical approach**, engineering features that **reflect real-world liver disease progression**. This improves both interpretability and predictive power.

This project is an **in-depth analysis of the Ames Housing dataset**, where I applied **machine learning models** to predict house sale prices. Instead of merely running standard models, I leveraged **feature engineering, domain knowledge, and advanced model comparison** techniques to improve prediction accuracy.  

🔹 **Key Highlights:**
- 📌 **Feature Engineering:** Grouped related features to enhance predictive poIr  
- 📌 **Modeling:** Compared Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression  
- 📌 **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated RMSE and R² to measure model effectiveness  
 

📊 **Technologies Used:**
- Python 🐍 (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Decision Trees)  
- Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing  
- GitHub for Version Control 🛠  

📢 **🔬 Innovative Methods Used:**
Most approaches to this dataset focus on either **raw correlations** or **brute-force feature selection**. My approach **leverages real-estate knowledge** to construct meaningful categories (e.g., grouping porch types, analyzing basement features separately), which led to better model interpretability and stronger predictions...in some cases. See the write-up where I explain.

This project tackles the **challenge of optimizing a medley relay lineup**, where swimmers often excel in multiple strokes, creating trade-offs in event selection. Instead of guessing or manually shuffling times, I developed an **Excel Solver-based optimization model** to automatically determine the fastest possible relay combination.
