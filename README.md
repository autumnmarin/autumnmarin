# 👋 Hello!

## 🌟 About Me

Hello! I'm Autumn 🎓, a recent graduate from the Georgia Tech Analytics Masters Program 🐝. As a data scientist, I have an unending curiosity for uncovering patterns in data, transforming insights into action 💡, and communicating results in a way that drives meaningful impact 🤖.

## :house: 🎯 Recent End-to-End Project: Predicting House Prices in Ames
**[🔗 GitHub Repository](<ADD-YOUR-REPO-LINK-HERE>)**  

This project is an **in-depth analysis of the Ames Housing dataset**, where I applied **machine learning models** to predict house sale prices. Instead of merely running standard models, I leveraged **feature engineering, domain knowledge, and advanced model comparison** techniques to improve prediction accuracy.  

🔹 **Key Highlights:**
- 📌 **Feature Engineering:** Grouped related features to enhance predictive power  
- 📌 **Modeling:** Compared Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression  
- 📌 **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated RMSE and R² to measure model effectiveness  
 

📊 **Technologies Used:**
- Python 🐍 (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Decision Trees)  
- Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing  
- GitHub for Version Control 🛠  

📢 **Why This Matters:**  
Most approaches to this dataset focus on either **raw correlations** or **brute-force feature selection**. My approach **leverages real-estate knowledge** to construct meaningful categories (e.g., grouping porch types, analyzing basement features separately), which led to better model interpretability and stronger predictions...in some cases. See the write-up where I explain.
